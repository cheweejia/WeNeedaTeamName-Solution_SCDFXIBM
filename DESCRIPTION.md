# Solution
The basis of the solution is that the elderly will be moving around the house to carry out his/her daily activities, such as going to the toilet, having a meal, taking a nap etc. Hence, in the unfortunate event when the elderly has met an incident and is unable to notify anyone, there will be inactivity in the house for an extended period of time. The detection of this inactivity will be alerted to the MyResponders App, which will then deploy the nearest CFR to check in with the elderly. The time that was saved in detecting the elderly in distress early can be a matter of life and death.

## Considerations
1. Privacy is a prominant issue with regards to the use of technology in today's world. We wanted to be able to monitor the elderly's activity at home, with as little intrusion as possible. This is so that our solution can be more widely accepted by the general public.
2. There is a wide range of scenarios that can result in inactivity in the house, for example the elderly could have been spending time outside of the house, the elderly could have been asleep etc. Our solution has to be able to cover
3.
